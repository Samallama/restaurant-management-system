# restaurant-management-system

We are a group of students from the Informatic Institute of Technology in Sri Lanka looking to create an Android application for our second semester coursework.

Our application is a restaurant management system that allows:
  -waiters to view tables, add, edit and delete orders and view the status of orders using an android application
  -kitchen staff to view incoming orders and update the status of an orders using a web based application
  -restaurant managers to view the overall processes happening in the restaurant and to append the database using a web based       application
  -hosts to add, edit and delete reservation details using an android application
